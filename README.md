CILAB IMU SENSOR

The Cilab IMU was designed with multi-sensor fusion which works underwater. 
It includes a typical Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Barometer unit and thermometer. 
Communication is enabled via I2C to various devices. 
The Cilab IMU GUI allows user to visualize the real time IMU sensor data and view the virtual IMU sensor through a Arduino board. 
Arduino communicate with IMU sensor via I2C and transfer real time data to PC through serial commination.
